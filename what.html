    <h2>What is it?</h2>

    <p class="p">The program is about 10 candidates, who have to complete assignments by which they can earn money. However, one of the group members is the <strong>Mole</strong>. The other candidates do not know who the mole is, and need to unmask them. The mole's goal is to make the assignments fail and keep the amount of money earned as low as possible.
      <br> At the end of every episode the candidates take a multiple choice test about the mole's identity. The test contains 20 questions (40 questions in the final test) about the mole's activities since the previous test and personal questions about the mole (for example, "On which team was the mole during the castle-assignment" or "Has the mole been baptized?"). With the help of 'jokers', which they can earn during the assignments, the contestants can turn incorrect test answers into correct answers.
      <br> The person with the fewest correct answers is then expelled from the show. In most series this process continues until only two contestants and the mole remain. The winner is the person with the most correct answers in the final test and he or she gets all of the money earned during the previous stages of the game.</p>
